Custom deep learning library

## Overview

### Built With

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Linear algebra
### Authors

* **James Davey** - *head of technology at* [WarwickAI](https://warwickai.ml/)

## Updating github

Firstly, To push this remote branch to your github branch use the code

```python
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push -u origin dev
```


Secondly, we want to merge all the changes from our `dev` branch into the `master`.

```python
(on branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
git checkout master
git merge development (there won't be any conflicts now)
git pull
```
